# Milestone-2

User story: As a consumer looking to plan a vacation while using GlobeTrotter's website, I want to be able to search for a location and the results of the map that comes back should provide me with tourist attraction sites and more (restaurants, bars, museums, etc.).

User story: as a consumer looking to search for "tourist attractions" at a particular location. I can simply search "Tourist attractions in Seattle, WA USA" (for example) if I want tourist attractions in Seattle, Washington USA.

User story: as a consumer looking to search for "bars" or "restaurants" at a particular location. I can simply search for either key word followed by the location I'm wanting to search for and results will come up with that particular location.

Code to render the google map API with the search function was taken from this jsfiddle and google maps api documentation:
